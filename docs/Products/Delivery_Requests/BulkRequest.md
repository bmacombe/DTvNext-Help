#### Step 2 - Dealer Selection (Managers Only)

If you are a manager you will be asked if you are submitting this request on behalf of yourself or one of your dealers.  Dealers will not see this step and will move directly to Step 3.

#### Step 8 - Delivery Location Verification

You will be asked to verify the contact and location you selected is correct and to add any additional information required.  Changes may also be made if you found the contact you wanted but the address, contacts or phone numbers are not correct for this delivery.  Any changes you make to their contact information only apply to this request and are not saved back to the original source.

#### Step 9 - Drop Management

Here you may make adjustments to existing drops, add new drops or delete a drop.  When adding a new drop you will be asked steps 6 to 8 again for the new location.  You then will be able to make an adjustment to move a portion of the total load to the new drop.  The amount you specify for the new drop will be removed from the first drop.
